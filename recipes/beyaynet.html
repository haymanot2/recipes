        <p>Ethiopian dishes typically consist of injera, 
               a spongy sourdough flatbread made of fermented teff flour, 
               spread flat over a communal pan (a large platter) and topped 
               with several kinds of spicy and non spicy wats (stews) and vegetables. 
               As I’m vegetarian, my neighbor suggested we make yetsom beyaynetu, 
               the vegetarian combination platter. It’s made up of a mix of vegan 
               curries and vegetables served on a plate of injera. Yetsom means fasting 
               and beyaynetu means combination platter. In principle, the combination platter 
               is very similar in composition, but not flavor, to an Indian thali.</p>
