        <p>In Ethiopia, there is a tradition of dry cooking onions before adding any fat. I was skeptical at the restaurant, but my boss, Meselesh Ayele, convinced me right away. Dry cooking onions concentrates flavor and reduces water in a dish. It matters.

            Other than that, you simply stew your chicken or whatever a long time, until it’s tender. You sometimes need to add a little water, but look at the pictures: Doro wat is stewed chicken, not chicken stew. There’s a difference.
            
            Towards the end, stab a few hard-boiled eggs with a fork, then add them in for a few minutes to absorb flavor.</p>
